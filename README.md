# DNS-Tester
This script aims to test the effectiveness of DNS ad-blockers.
Inside the script you can configure up to 5 dns services and the name of the Output file. 
If you run it, it will download [this list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/blacklist/master/adservers.txt) of ad servers and clean it up for us to use.
It then test all these urls and saves the result in a .csv file.
